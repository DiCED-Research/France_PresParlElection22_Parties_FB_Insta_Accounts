# Facebook and Instagram Accounts of Parties Running in the 2022 French Presidential and Parliamentary Elections

This repository includes a list of the Facebook accounts and the Instagram accounts of political parties in the presidential candidates in the French Presidential and Parliamentary Elections held between April and June, 2022.

This list of informal/supporting candidate accounts was collected as part of the DiCED project: https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/diced/. Digital Campaigning and Electoral Democracy (DiCED) is a 5 year cross-national project designed to investigate the impact of digital technology on the organization, implementation and impact of political campaigns. The project is led by Rachel Gibson, a Professor of Political Science from The University of Manchester and includes academic partners based in Europe and the U.S. Focusing on elections in the USA, the UK, France, Germany and Poland, the project will offer one of the first systematic insights into where ‘data-driven’ campaigning is emerging, and its implications for the political behaviour and attitudes of voters, as well as party organization in these nations.
